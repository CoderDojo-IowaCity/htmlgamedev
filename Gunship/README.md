Gunship

This project demonstrates several key features that are useful when writing applications in JavaScript:
- The use of sprites to create animated images
- The use of the HTML5 Canvas element
- Object oriented methods of building the game.
- Extensive use of JSON syntax.
- Some useful mathematical constructs for managing games

The Game
========
The game we are building is a simple shooter game. We have a helicopter gunship that tries to stem the
tide of invading bugs. The Gunship has the advantage that it can shoot bullets in three directions simultaneously:
up, down, and forward. The gunship can move in all four directions.

There is a steady stream of bugs and they are added to the game faster as the game progresses.

We start off by deciding what the core objects of our game will be.

Then we start building the game with a blank HTML5 Canvas that we paint with the terrain.
