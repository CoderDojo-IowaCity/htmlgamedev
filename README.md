HTML Game Development Course
===========

Game development is an area every kid talks about when you ask them what they want to learn, and who are we to dissappoint.
This will be coderdojo's first HTML game focused course.  During the weeks we will teach how you build some really cool web
games and in doing so teach the following key principles
* functions
* variables
* logic (if, else)
* loops

I am hoping this course will the first course built on collaboration between dojo's, so I encourage you to raise issues with 
game's ideas and we will build this in an opensource manner.
